### Extraction Method
Used Python with HTML parsing to extract content from large Framer-generated HTML files that contained massive inline CSS/JS. Focused on meaningful content while filtering out framework code.

### Accuracy
All text content, image URLs, and structural elements have been accurately extracted. Some minor formatting may need adjustment during React implementation.

### Missing Elements
- Exact color codes (use inspector or color picker on original site if needed)
- Animation timings (recommendations provided in guide)
- Form field validation rules (to be defined during implementation)
